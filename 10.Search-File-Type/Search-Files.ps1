DESCRIPTION
This script will search a file structure for a specific file type and export the results to a CSV file. 
This can be used to search a user accessible file share for file types that you may have policies 
against storing on a file share. If you donâ€™t have access to Enterprise tools like FSRM this is an 
easy way to provide similar functionality.
