Ready to build your own automation powerhouse with AI capabilities all self-hosted in the cloud?

In this step-by-step tutorial, I’ll walk you through how to deploy **n8n**, the open-source workflow automation tool, on a **Linux VM in Azure**, secured with **HTTPS** using a **Cloudflare Tunnel**, and powered by the **n8n AI Starter Kit**.

What you'll learn:
- How to create and configure a Linux VM in Azure with PowerShell
- Installing Docker and Portainer on the VM
- Setting up a Cloudflare Tunnel to expose your n8n instance securely over HTTPS
- Custom domain configuration (e.g. `n8n.powershellbot.com`)
